As well as all the business development chat, there is also plenty of talk in there about how Kevin coaches a huge variety of populations and how his language, demonstrations and education differs. Enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>In this episode, you will learn -<\/p>\n<ul><li>Who is Kevin Carr (background, education & current role)<\/li>\n<li>Day/week in the life on Kevin Carr<\/li>\n<li>General population vs professional athletes\n<ul><li>Language<\/li>\n<li>Demonstration<\/li>\n<li>Education<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Private sector vs pro/collegiate setting\n<ul><li>Lifestyle<\/li>\n<li>Work life balance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Working with Mike Boyle\n<ul><li>Biggest lessons learnt from Mike<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Working in ice hockey\n<ul><li>Strategies to keep players on the ice<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Industry changes\n<ul><li>Expectations as a coach<\/li>\n<li>Pressures as a coach<\/li>\n<li>Tips for coaches wanting to get in<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Kevin can be found on Twitter <a href='https://twitter.com/CoachKevinCarr'>@CoachKevinCarr<\/a> and on Instagram <a href='https://www.instagram.com/movementasmedicine/'>@movementasmedicine<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Keep up to date with everything that is going on with the podcast by following on Twitter <a href='http://twitter.com/strengthofsci'>@strengthofsci<\/a> or visiting <a href='../episode/strengthofscience.com'>strengthofscience.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy<\/p>\n<p>PP<\/p>\n","<p>In this episode of the Pacey Performance Podcast, I am speaking to Head Performance & Strength & Conditioning Coach at the Sacramento Kings, Ramsey Nijem.

I have been lucky enough to spend a day with Jonas and can say first hand that he has a fantastic eye for detail and there is a reason he has coaches numerous sub 10s sprinters.

Sophia is a Professor at Edith Cowen University and has featured <a href='https://www.strengthofscience.com/pacey-performance-podcast/pacey-performance-podcast-158-sophia-nimphius-part-2/'>on the podcast before<\/a> chatting about change of direction, however this is an area that she is extremely passionate about and in this episode provides some stories that really shocked and disappointed me about our industry. Lorena Torres is Performance Director at the Philadelphia 76ers and, like Sophia provides an incredible insight into what its like being a female in such a male-dominated industry such as strength and conditioning. Brian is a Director of Online Sports Degrees at the University of Denver and recently co-authors the book, 'Understanding Strength and Conditioning as Sport Coaching: Bridging the Biophysical, Pedagogical and Sociocultural Foundations of Practice' so is well versed in this area.

Adam has a fascinating story, coming from a military background and ending up at the Dolphins after studying at the University of Miami. For someone who by his own admission is more or an S&C coach than what we may class as a sports scientist, he is doing an incredible job. Bridging the gap between the two roles and the technical coaches is something we dive deep into during this episode as I feel that this is sometimes missed in conversations about sports technology.<\/p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this episode with Adam Lachance, you may enjoy these episodes that also discuss force plate analysis with <a href='https://www.strengthofscience.com/pacey-performance-podcast/pacey-performance-podcast-213-eric-renaghan/'>Eric Renaghan<\/a>, <a href='https://www.strengthofscience.com/pacey-performance-podcast/pacey-performance-podcast-139-dr-daniel-cohen/'>Daniel Cohen<\/a>, and <a href='https://www.strengthofscience.com/pacey-performance-podcast/pacey-performance-podcast-149/'>Phil Graham Smith<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In this episode, we discuss -<\/p>\n\n<ul><li>Who is Adam Lachance (background, education and current role)<\/li>\n<li>How the military has influenced your career?\n<ul><li>What pro sport can learn from the military<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Force plate analysis\n<ul><li>Performance\n<ul><li>Collecting trainable metrics<\/li>\n<li>Improving metrics through training<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Readiness & fatigue\n<ul><li>Metrics and analysis<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Reviewing technology\n<ul><li>Which metrics can we trust?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Feedback of information<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>The sports science position\n<ul><li>Understanding the constraints of the game, environment, competition<\/li>\n<li>Being athlete facing vs being behind a laptop<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\nAdam can be found on LinkedIn <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-lachance-b2886b98/'>HERE<\/a>.\n \nThis episode of the Pacey Performance Podcast is sponsored by <a href='https://www.ouotputsports.com'>Output Sports<\/a> – a Swiss Army Knife for optimising off field performance.

Prior to this, Matt has worked at the University of Texas and University of Denver, designing and implementing speed, strength, conditioning, and mobility training programs for men’s lacrosse, alpine ski, baseball, tennis, swimming and track and field.<\/p>\n<p>Matt talks to Rob about performance pillars, testing, and monitoring – subjects that he has recently written about in one of his many books, articles and blogs. This includes the metrics that sports scientists and coaches should be looking at in regards to GPS data, and the six physical performance qualities he looks for when measuring improvement. Matt further explains how to incorporate specialist training when faced with constraints, such as time.<\/p>\n<p>There’s also some outstanding insight into a range of exercises and techniques, including triphasic training, oscillatory training, isometric exercises as a part of that, and understanding physics when it comes to power development. Matt also gives us some examples of further reading in these areas, which will be invaluable to any coach.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>On the podcast this week:<\/p>\n<ul><li>The metrics to be looking at when it comes to GPS<\/li>\n<li>How to test and monitor to see whether an athlete is improving<\/li>\n<li>Matt’s 6 physical performance qualities<\/li>\n<li>How to incorporate sprints when faced with limited time<\/li>\n<li>Practical examples of preparing players when faced with constraints<\/li>\n<li>Triphasic training<\/li>\n<li>Oscillatory training<\/li>\n<li>Eccentric training<\/li>\n<li>Isometric exercises<\/li>\n<li>Understanding physics when it comes to power development<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","<p>This week’s guest on the Pacey Performance Podcast is sports psychologist Dan Abrahams. Dan became a psychologist following a stint as a professional golfer with an interest in the mental side of the sport. After calling time on his playing career, he became a coach and followed that up by gaining a master’s degree in sports psychology. He’s been working in this capacity for 16 years now, including for England Rugby, England Golf, and numerous Premier League football clubs.<\/p>\n<p>Following the recent Olympic and Paralympic Games, sports psychology has been in the spotlight more than ever. Dan discusses the impact this has had on the subject, including how an athlete’s mental state can be rated on a three-stage ‘traffic light’ system depending on their current needs. He also addresses the theory that you cannot coach attitude, effort and energy - although the athlete is responsible for their own attitude, Dan explains how coaches and sports psychologists can create an environment that engages athletes and helps them maintain all-important intensity when training. If you’re interested in the mental side of coaching and sports science, then this week’s podcast is for you.<\/p>\n<p>This week’s topics:<\/p>\n<ul><li>How sports psychology is currently split between athlete performance, wellbeing and mental health<\/li>\n<li>Why sporting organisations need to address all three as psychology becomes more prominent<\/li>\n<li>Why sports clubs on a budget could spend time educating their existing coaches in sports psychology<\/li>\n<li>Why it’s said that you can’t coach attitude, effort and energy<\/li>\n<li>How coaches can engage athletes and maintain all-important intensity during training<\/li>\n<li>How to create a positive training environment that gets the best from athletes<\/li>\n<li>Building relationships with athletes – and maintaining boundaries between the personal and professional<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","<p>This week’s Pacey Performance Podcase sees Rob joined by Sean Cumming; Professor of Paediatric Exercise at the University of Bath. He’s also been conducting a lot of work with the Lawn Tennis Association, Premier League, and the Football Association regarding the growth and development of young athletes. This is exactly what he speaks about this week, both in terms of physical and mental development.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Sean discusses how a young athlete’s development can be shaped by the selection biases surrounding a particular sport, and how late and early development can be both beneficial and a drawback. Sean and Rob also discuss how training – both individually and as a group – can be adapted so everyone can meet their potential. This includes how to monitor maturation both with and without a budget – a must for many coaches at local and community sports clubs.

Throughout his career, Matt has consulted with more than 30 Olympic and World Championship medallists, and he frequently provides his expertise to high-performance sport organisations. Matt has been a strength and conditioning coach and applied sport scientist working with international athletes for over six Olympic Winter Games. In addition to being the Director of Sport Science at the Canadian Sport Institute Calgary, Matt is an Adjunct Professor in the Faculty of Kinesiology at the University of Calgary.<\/p>\n<p>On the podcast, Matt discusses a topic he wrote about in High Performance Training for Sports (2nd Edition) – efficiency of movement. Not only does Matt define what efficiency of movement is, but he also explains how experts apply it to training programmes. He also dives into the strength training framework for mechanical efficiency, and how isometric training should be adapted to apply to specific sports. Continuing the technical side of things, Matt also talks about loading for technical efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>Matt also talks about some of the psychological aspects of sport science, such as why coaches need to remember that they are ‘servants of performance’ and not become transfixed on their own particular way of doing things. In a similar vein, Matt speaks about how coaches can detach from irrelevant information and see a problem for what it is, and avoid the pitfalls of following the same model again and again.

He’s previously coached the Dutch and Chinese women’s volleyball teams, and worked for EXOS Athlete Performance for seven years. Prior to that, he learned his trade coaching younger athletes in strength training between the ages of 8 and 18 in Southern California.<\/p>\n<p>Rett’s here to talk about warming up, cooling down, and why it can pay to coach younger athletes before moving on to adult-aged coaching. As well as the benefits of experience, coaches can really see how to engage with a group and notice the smaller performance details. With warming up, Rett is an expert in this field gives key advice on how to design effective warm ups, structure sessions, and why keeping things ‘messy’ can be more beneficial.<\/p>\n<p>Rett also discusses cool downs, again discussing how to structure such sessions, keep the coach’s own ego in check relating to athletes’ attitude towards them, and how to maintain attention once the main training session is over.

Simon spent five seasons as the Head of Physical Performance for the Crusaders in Super Rugby, and has now moved on to Major League Rugby side Austin Gilgronis in the United States. Following four titles in New Zealand with Crusaders, Simon decided to take on a new challenge in Texas, joining up with head coach Sam Harris whom he had previously worked with at Honda Heat in Japan. Simon is here to talk about the growth of Major League Rugby, the cultural differences between the sport in traditional rugby nations and the USA, and how there are 300 million rugby fans who just don’t know it yet.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to life in Texas at a fledgling side, Simon also discusses how to set up a successful preseason training camp, including the values to establish, the key objectives, and reflection on the group and their achievements the previous year. One of these training camps proved controversial as the team trained with the US Navy SEALs – as observers on social media waded in with opinions on whether that style of training was appropriate. However, Simon here explains the background behind it all, including the planning and preparation that led to it happening.<\/p>\n<p>This background included the psychological element to the training camp, including how to get players into a routine of accountability, communication, and responding to effective leadership. Simon also talks about how to build trusting relationships between coaches and the team to allow this to happen, plus what the markers of a successful preseason can be.

For half that time, he’s also been a rehab coordinator before moving to a new role as Head of Strength and Conditioning at the New South Wales Institute of Sport.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, Simon’s article on his rehab running framework was published on Sportsmith. Here, he talks about how that framework came into being and the process he went through to develop it. One problem he found as an S&C coach was the gap between learning how to coach athletes to push themselves, and the practicalities of helping an athlete return from injury. In his rehab running framework, he’s provided structure for coaches to follow to bridge this gap.<\/p>\n<p>Simon speaks with Rob about the different facets of his framework, including its basic structure, with examples of how it can be used for hamstring and calf injuries. He explains some easy drills to use during rehab, plus how to assess athlete process and when to change the level of training required when an athlete gets to a certain condition.

He’s back for part 2 following his initial chat with Rob on this very podcast back in July 2021.<\/p>\n<p>This time around, Joseph is here to talk about jump profiling. He discusses how to understand the best exercise for an athlete based on their sport and role, including what success in training looks like in sports not measured in height or distance. This leads into Joseph’s sport relevance classification, including unilateral/bilateral work, the effect of direction and approach, and how different surfaces can impact on jumping.<\/p>\n<p>Joseph also answers questions about what an athlete’s movement signature tells us about how to improve performance, whether athletes and coaches should concentrate on force or velocity, and how to assess whether athletes need to improve sequencing and coordination to see improved results.

We’re going to learn how Max made that jump through the ranks, starting with his time as the owner of a gym where St Pauli’s players came to train.<\/p>\n<p>Following his move to Bundesliga 2., he talks about the times he had to create full training programmes with minimal access to facilities, identifying the gaps in a training programme and plugging them, followed by when it’s time to leave a role once you feel you’ve fulfilled your potential. Subsequently, Max then tells us how he then made the big transition from S&C coach to the Earthquakes’ Director of Performance.<\/p>\n<p>In his current role, Max discusses the influence he can exert over training programmes, and the particular processes and systems he prefers to put into place to achieve certain results. From his now more senior position, he also offers insight into how management and leadership differ, and how undertaking an MBA has impacted his day-to-day life.

This includes the importance of tendon structure – and why this subject has been dividing opinion. Seth moves onto what causes changes to tendon structure, including ageing and how this can be mitigated for. There’s also some insight into muscle stiffness versus tendon stiffness, and how both affect performance.<\/p>\n<p>Seth also discusses isometric training, including what does and doesn’t work for him in order to get the best performance benefits. He also talks about how isometrics can be the gateway to rehabilitation and how pain comes into the equation.

Shawn currently serves as a personal performance advisor and movement coach for more than a dozen NFL players.<\/p>\n<p>Coaching agility is much more than setting up cones and letting the athletes run routes around them. Agility is much more than just change of direction ability. But with so much complexity to improve the physical quality of \"agility\", how can we coach it effectively to ensure transfer to the field? In this episode, Shawn details his approach which dives into the world of ecological dynamics and a constraints led approach. He explains how his approach differs to a \"traditional\" approach of pre-planned movements and drilling them time after time. Shawn presents an example of a closed drill which aims to improve cutting and develops it into a much more open drill so the athlete has to react to a changing environment, much like they would have to do on game day.<\/p>\n<p>This is an excellent episode for anyone that wants to ensure their time spent on the field developing \"agility\" is actually transferring to the field.<\/p>\n<p>Talking points -<\/p>\n<p>• Typical NFL drills to improve agility and how they can be improved<\/p>\n<p>• Traditional approach versus an ecological approach to drill design<\/p>\n<p>• How to integrate a constraints led approach into agility training<\/p>\n<p>• Closed drills vs open drills<\/p>\n<p>• Problems with coaching to a fixed movement profile<\/p>\n","<p>Sian featured on episode #391 of the Pacey Performance Podcast.

This episode was originally recorded in 2020 as a Live roundtable but because the information on velocity based training (VBT) was so incredible, we decided to release it as a podcast.<\/p>\n<p>Dan, Lachlan and Jonathon are most certainly authorities in this area from both a practical and academic perspective. All three of these guys know this area inside out. Firstly we start by tackling a few misunderstandings when it comes to VBT and then chat through why each of the guests decide to implement VBT in their different environments.<\/p>\n<p>There seems to be a disconnect between the science of VBT and its application. On paper it looks great but implementing it in practice seems to be a barrier to some coaches. Is it the technology available, is it athlete buy-in, is it friction when it comes to programming? Jonathon gives his view here given his recent review of this area in his paper, Velocity-based training: From theory to application.<\/p>\n<p>If you are interested in this area and haven't read this article, its free to download on Researchgate. We finish off this episode with a quick fire round of questions, tackling some of the common issues when interpreting the science and translating that into practice.<\/p>\n<p>If you're looking for in-depth information on velocity based training, listen to three experts in this area on this episode of the podcast.<\/p>\n<p>Main talking points -<\/p>\n<ul><li>What is velocity based training?<\/li>\n<li>Why is it misunderstood?<\/li>\n<li>When VBT shouldn't be implemented with a programme?<\/li>\n<li>Why is there a disconnect between VBT science and application?<\/li>\n<li>Is bar path really an essential metric to track using VBT technology?<\/li>\n<li>What metrics to focus on to maximise bang for buck<\/li>\n<li>How can we help coaches successfully implement VBT in an applied setting<\/li>\n<li>Using velocity loss<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","<p>This week on the Pacey Performance Podcast, Rob is speaking to Dr. Shaun McLaren about all things RPEs and subjective measures.<\/p>\n<p>RPE is no doubt the most used tool for coaches to understand an athlete's response to training. But just asking an athlete for a number to rate how hard a session was has lots of moving parts. When do you ask them? How do you ask them? Do you provide the scale on paper so they can see it? What scale are you using? Is the scale valid? How these questions are answered can have significant impact on the quality of data we get. And we all want to maximise data quality and not waste our or our athlete's time.<\/p>\n<p>In this episode, Shaun gives some great recommendations how we can make the \"right\" decisions when setting up a system to collect RPEs and other subjective measures. But before he does that, Shaun gives us a great overview of why he thinks RPEs are so valuable and the science behind their being. The type of scale used has sparked a number of Twitter debates about the type of scale that is used. So we dive into that black hole and Shaun explains why using a valid scale is so important and some of the downfalls coaches make when using non-validated options.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to maximise the RPE and subjective data that you are collecting, press play on the episode with Shaun on your chosen podcast player.<\/p>\n<p>Main topics -<\/p>\n<ul><li>What does this data really tell us?
